ImageNet Project
================

This is a personal project for developing skills in python, learning how to use
github and testing different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures
for image recognition and possibly other applications.

Despite having previous experiences in coding with CNNs in PyTorch, I've always
felt overwhelmed by the number of different of ways that one can combine
convolutional, max-pooling and linear layers - with different kernel sizes and
padding sizes, strides, dilation and feature numbers.

My objective is to develop skills in python while exploring a variety of CNN
architectures to find in practice which ones work best for different
applications.
